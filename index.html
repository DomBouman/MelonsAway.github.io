This is my first full website, and will remain a work in progress until I am satisfied with it (so probably never).

      <p class="inline"> Major update number one is up! Major changes include getting rid of the last of those pesky lorem ipsum text blocks and placeholder images</p>

      <p class="inline">The site is up! It's still a very rough project, and will be a work in progress for a while, so check back often if you want to stay up to date. This weekend will be especially busy, with updates like replacing the placeholder images and what's left of the lorem ipsum text; and adding details to things.</p>
      <p>For now, here are some things I used to build the site. For the record, none of this is sponsored this is just what I used. I used <a href="https://placekitten.com" class="link">Placekitten</a> for the images, as you probably noticed. This is a fantastic little site for placeholder images, similar to <a href="https://placeholder.com" class="link">Placeholder</a> but with kittens in stead of grey boxes. I used Atom to write everything, and MDN was an incredibly useful resource.</p>
